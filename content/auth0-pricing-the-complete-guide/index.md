## What is Auth0?

Auth0 is an authentication and authorization software as a service platform. It started in 2013 as an identity management service to allow developers to connect their apps to enterprise and social providers easily.

Over the years they have scaled their services, achieved compliance certifications, and added more features. 


## Auth0 Pricing

Auth0’s offerings can be broadly categorized into their free and paid plans.

### Free Plan

- Auth0’s free plan allows having up to 7000 MAUs and up to 2 social connections and 3 Actions, Rules, and hooks.
- This tier is ideal for testing out Auth0 or for personal projects, but, with limitations on social connections and features like user roles and custom domains being behind a paywall, you are incentivized to move to the paid plans for more serious projects.

### Paid Plans
Auth0 splits its paid plans into 2 sections based on whether your app is “B2C” or “B2B”. , Each use case has it's own Essential, Professional, and Enterprise tiers. In both cases, the Enterprise tier has fully custom pricing.

**Use Case 1: Business to Consumer**
> Note: Both the Essential and Professional tiers allow for up to 10,000 monthly active users. If you cross these thresholds you will be asked to move to the Enterprise tier.

- **Essential**:
  - The essential plan allows for unlimited social connections, custom domains, and user role management. You also get 2 more Actions, Rules and Hooks.
  - Pricing starts at $23/month for 1,000 users and scales to $228/month for 10,000 users.

- **Professional:** 
  - The professional plan adds multifactor authentication, admin roles, the ability to connect an external database, and additional action, rules, and hooks.
  - Pricing starts at $240/month for 1,000 and scales to $1,500/month.

- **Enterprise:**
  - The Enterprise plan has 99.99% SLA & Enterprise Support and advanced cloud deployment options. This tier also allows private deployments.
  - Enterprise pricing is completely custom and requires you to talk with an Auth0 sales representative. From our research, it seems enterprise plans start at $30,000 / year ($2,500 / month) but scales to 6 and 7 figures as well.

**Use Case 2: Business to Business**
Similar to the first use case, the B2B plan also has essential, professional, and enterprise tiers. 

> Note: Both the Essential and Professional tiers allow for up to 7,000 monthly active users. If you cross these thresholds you will be asked to move to the Enterprise tier.

- **Essential:**
  - The essential plan offers enterprise connections, multi-factor authentication, user role management, and organizations.
  - Pricing starts at $130/month for 500 users and scales to $1,420/month for 7,000 users.
- **Professional:**
  - The professional plan allows you to connect your database and increases the number of organizations and the actions, rules, and hooks.
  - Pricing starts at $800/month for 500 users and scales to $1,800/month for 7,000 users.
- **Enterprise:**
  - The Enterprise plan has 99.99% SLA & Enterprise Support and advanced cloud deployment options. This tier also allows private deployments.
  - It removes restrictions on the number of Monthly Active Users.
  - Enterprise pricing is completely custom and requires you to talk with an Auth0 sales representative.  From our research, it seems enterprise plans start at $30,000 / year ($2,500 / month) but scales to 6 and 7 figures as well.

**Should you use Auth0?**
- Integrating with Auth0 is easy. They support a large number of frameworks and have dedicated guides explaining their features, but, their pricing does not scale well.
- Since the Okta acquisition, Auth0 has restructured its features and pricing forcing some users into the enterprise tier. This could result in them paying up to 4 times more for features they do not need. 
- Enterprise pricing is also non-existent on their website. Users are required to get on a sales call to discuss pricing in this tier. This increases the difficulty of evaluating Auth0 for your company.
- Auth0 does offer a plan for startups. For a year they will provide the entire platform for free but will revert to the default pricing model once the startup plan expires.


## Auth0 Alternative: Supertokens

### What is SuperTokens?

- **Self-Hosted:**
  - Free forever for unlimited users.
- **Managed Service:**
  - Free for the first 5000 MAUs.
  - 2 cents / MAU post the first 5000 MAUs.

### Should you use SuperTokens?
SuperToken’s feature set and pricing make it an excellent choice for startups and mid-level businesses, but it may not be the best fit for large organizations that require enterprise features.
